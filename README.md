# Accessible Virtual Keyboard
*November 14th, 2018*

## Dedicated to Benjamin Knapp
Approximately 7 years ago, Benjamin Knapp experienced cardiac arrest. Today, he has difficulty moving and speaking, but can
communicate with others by squeezing his fingers and opening his mouth. These small muscle movements can be used to create an
efficient communication device that will be able to help Ben type his thoughts on a virtual keyboard, and even speak words and sentences with the aid of a text-to-speech program. This project's purpose is to develop a predictive virtual keyboard that can be controlled with two binary inputs. This keyboard can be installed on a Raspberry Pi and connected to two [MyoWare Muscle Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723) to allow people with disabilities to communicate concisely and efficiently.

## Getting Started
The following items are needed for this project:
* **1x** [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* **2x** [MyoWare Muscle Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723)
* **1x** Display for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* **1x** Speaker for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

For a complete list of parts, see the [parts-list.md](/docs/parts-list.md) file.

### Prerequisites
After obtaining the previous items, install a Linux or Unix operating system (preferrably [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)).

## Installation
A step-by-step guide with examples that tell you how to install the program.

### Deployment
Any additional notes on how to deploy the virtual accessible keyboard on the system.

## Execution
A step-by-step guide with examples that tell you how to execute the program.

### Functionality
Explain each function of the accessible virtual keyboard.
