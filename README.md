# Accessible Virtual Keyboard for Communication Disabilities
*November 14th, 2018*

A predictive virtual keyboard that can be controlled with two binary inputs. This keyboard can be installed on a Raspberry Pi and connected to two [MyoWare Muscle Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723) to allow people with disabilities to communicate concisely and efficiently.

## Getting Started
The following items are needed for this project:
* [ ] **1x** [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* [ ] **2x** [MyoWare Muscle Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723)
* [ ] **1x** Display for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* [ ] **1x** Analog speaker for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

### Prerequisites
After obtaining the previous items, install a Linux or Unix operating system (preferrably [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)).

## Installation
A step-by-step guide with examples that tell you how to install the program.

### Deployment
Any additional notes on how to deploy the virtual accessible keyboard on the system.

## Execution
A step-by-step guide with examples that tell you how to execute the program.

### Functionality
Explain each function of the accessible virtual keyboard.
